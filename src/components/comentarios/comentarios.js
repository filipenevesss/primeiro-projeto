                        <p class="textcmt">The Batman is a fantastic film. This movie really explores batman in a very different way. Robert Pattinson does a phenomenal job as the caped crusader, so much so that when you look at batman, you also see Bruce Wayne and his inner torment and darkness lurking within. The scenes with Bruce without the suit interacting and Alfred were very effective and powerful. All the characters are true to what they are supposed to be like. All the actors which include Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Andy Serkis, Collin Farrell, Paul Dano do an excellent job at helming these iconic characters. My only problem is that at times the characters survive things that they shouldn't be able to. The story is very well thought out and meticulously planned and crafted. The Villain, Riddler, is tragic, understandable, smart, cunning, and overall effective and I had no problems with him. The action is expertly choreographed, very well shot and confidently directed. This is by far the best looking batman movie. I love the Nolan films. The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies and favorite superhero film. But the cinematography by Greg Freizer is just pristine and down-right gorgeous. This film's visuals are on a whole another level. This is probably the best looking comic-book films I Have ever seen. It's only real competition is Aquaman (great looking film). Now Michael Giacchino had a very difficult task ahead of him. The character of Batman has been blessed with beautiful scores over the years, from the iconic score by Danny Elfman, to the underrated score in the animated series and the energetic and exciting score by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard (My Favorite). The Legacy is hard to Live up to. But I am happy to say that Michael Giacchino has composed a flawless score for this film which itself was enough to put me on the edge of my seat. Its just a testament to why he is hired to compose so many films. This is the best Batman score since The Dark Knight trilogy. Now I won't spoil, but at the end of this movie, Bruce learns a lesson and it was beautiful. The arc he has as Batman is amazing. It is something I have never seen in a comic-book film, and it perfectly sends the message of what a hero is meant to be. This film actually delves deep into one aspect of Batman that the other films only addressed, and that is that he is 'The World's Greatest Detective'. That is what made the film so unique and fresh, the fact that is truly a mystery movie. Overall, you can probably see that I am very happy. I am honestly at a place with Batman right now where I have not been in a long time. This is my favorite Batman, DC, and probably favorite comic-book movie since The Dark Knight. its only real competition is Joker(2019). The Batman is an incredible experience. If it weren't for that problem I mentioned, this movie would have probably been better than The Dark Knight for me. This film is a technical masterpiece, and is beautifully written. Matt Reeves is truly one of the best film-makers working today. He showed promise from the start with films like The Planet of the Apes sequels and Cloverfield, and with this movie's trailers. The movie lives up to my hype and I had a Blast. In short, Go Watch It.</p>

                        <p class="textcmt">From the first scene itself, it is made clear the amount of thought, work and creativity that has gone into the making of this movie. This movie will scare you, indulge you in its mystery, excite you with its action and amaze you with its commitment to telling a truly dark and gritty tale about the corruption in Gotham. Matt Reeves has done masterful work in directing each scene. He is a point of view driven director. There are many shots in this movie where he puts you in the character's shoes and shows the world from his point of view and how the world perceives him. As Batman enters the crime scene you are put in his POV and can see how much each and every police officer sees him as a menace and doesn't want him to be there. This really helps establish the world and the relationship within in a very subtle way. He also has wonderfully implemented some scenes of horror and thriller which were unexpected and had given way to some nailbiting and riveting scenes! (I think I forgot to breathe during the Batmobile chase scene)
                            All the Matt Reeves direction has been enhanced by Greg Fraser's camerawork. Gotham is very dark and gritty but never feels dead. Unlike so many other movies, he allowed blacks to be actual black and not shades of grey and then dialled up the contrast allowing the colours to pop! Orange and blue colour has such amazing interplay between them and completely suits the dark depressing setting of Gotham.
                            Michael Giacchino's score for The Batman is his best work yet. As the film picks up in terms of action, you can start hearing little hints of Dum-Da-Dum-Dum pick up and you just know things are going to get intense. Other than the adrenaline-filled main theme he through his soundtrack is very well able to showcase moments of mystery, emotion and romance (Yes, this movie has romance!)
                            This might have been the least amount of talking done by The Batman in any of the Batman movies because Robert Pattinson is so well able to display emotions through his body language and expressions. Pattinson brings in a different take on Bruce Wayne, who is depressed and a little eccentric. A billionaire who has travelled the world to gather knowledge and is always analysing his surrounding is bound to be an introvert and kind of a recluse and this is very well showcased by him. Robert has done an amazing job. Talking about side characters there were loads of them and each one of them has done an amazing job. For me, the stand-out was definitely Penguin and Catwoman.
                            The story is a straight-up murder mystery thriller where Batman and Gordon are sent on a hunt by Riddler which reveals the deep dark secret of Gotham Elites including Batman's own past. Without spoiling much the story plays out very much like Se7en, Zodiac and The Long Halloween comic book. This allows the world's greatest detective to actually do some detective work and you get lost in that journey to trying to piece all the different puzzle pieces. The Batman is not a good story because it's an indulging murder mystery but because it allows the characters within to grow as well. As Batman, Catwoman, Alfred and Penguin are caught in the middle of these murders they all grow as a character in their own way which makes me excited for the sequel.
                            Finally, I would like to say in a world where most of the comic-book movies now seem like a painting of scenery you have seen a thousand times being sold in Walmart, here is a movie that is something that is hung on the entrance of a downtown museum brought to life by Picasso.</p>
